# Machine-Learning-for-Material-Classification
End-to-end ML pipeline in Python/scikit-learn for materials classification. Includes modular preprocessing, feature engineering, stratified splitting, and benchmarking of Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, and KNN. Feature analysis shows band gap predicts conductivity, enabling data-driven insights and cost reduction.
